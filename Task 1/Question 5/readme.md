Question 5..
</h2>
..is to get the house prices according to its size within certain limits which is governed by a specific equation and pass it into a csv file and draw a graph.

<br>
I First did a for loop and stored all the y and x values in a 2D List and added them to a csv. I then read that using pandas as a dataframe and used the size and price columns as x and y axes respectively and plotted a graph using the MatPlotLib library.
