Question 3..
</h2>
..is to read a text file and find the words with atleast 6 letters and the most frequently used word.
<br>
<br>
My first approach is the classic <b><i>string.split()</i></b> but the problem are the punctuation marks. For example the word "Numpy" but the program decided it as a 6 letter word because of a comma in the end of the word. So I wrote some code to remove the punction marks in the front and back of a word. <i>(line 4)</i>
